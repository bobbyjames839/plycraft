                        Loom began in a small garage, building for friends and family on weekends. What started
                        as a love for well-made objects turned into a studio that focuses on timeless design,
                        sustainable materials, and enduring craftsmanship. We work slowly and intentionally,
                        shaping pieces that feel natural in your space and better with age.
                    </p>
                    <p className="a-section-text">
                        Today, we continue that approach â€” fewer pieces, more attention, and an open process.
                        We sketch, prototype, and build by hand, selecting boards for grain and proportion,
                        and finishing surfaces for long-term care and repair.
